## 📋 What is oxide-dock?

oxide-dock is a desktop application starter kit that lets developers build apps you can use on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## 🚀 Getting Started With The App

When you open the app for the first time, you will see a simple welcome screen built with a clean design. The interface is made with Vue 3, so navigation is smooth and fast.

Basic things you can do:

- Use menus at the top or side to explore options.
- Access settings to customize how the app works or looks.
- Use local files or data safely within the app; it won’t require internet once installed.
- Expect fast startup and low memory use because oxide-dock apps don’t rely on heavy frameworks like Electron.

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

Apps made with oxide-dock use Rust and Tauri, which focus on security. Rust helps avoid crashes and bugs that can cause vulnerabilities. Tauri limits app access to system resources, helping keep your data private.

No data is sent to the internet unless the app specifically asks, so your information stays on your computer. This makes oxide-dock apps more private than traditional web-based or Electron apps.
